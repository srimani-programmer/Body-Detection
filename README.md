## Body Detection
A Machine Learning Model to detect our body Gestures using Tensorflow.js. The major benefits of this model is we can easily integrate with any browser based applications. No need to setup any hectic softwares to run this application.

### Requirements (Not Mandatory)

If you are a python programmer then defintely you should try this out using python server

### Application usage

2. Give Access to capture video.
3. If we want to make prediction over a another person then use diiferent example classifiers buttons on the application.
4. This appliction is completey build based on Google trained KNN Algorithm which gives the results upto 50% accurately.
5. We can improve our model using some other better techniques.
